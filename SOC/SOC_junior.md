## Description
As starters in the cybersecurity space, the position of junior SOC analyst is perfect to get to learn the basics of cybersecurity. This position briefly talks about the necessity to monitor and check systems for potential incoming attacks, we will learn the basics of SOC analyst and the fundamental knowledge to be able to acquire a position in that field.
For starters we will highlight the key function of a junior SOC analyst:

- Monitor and investigate the alerts
- Configure and manage the security tools
- Develop and implement basic IDS (Intrusion Detection System) signatures
- Participate in SOC working groups, meetings
- Create tickets and escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed

We can stay informed about current cyber security threats from public information points such as Twitter, or Feedly, Subreddits can also be useful.

A SOC team proactively uses SIEM (Security information and event management) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities. Imagine being a firefighter and having a multi-alarm fire - one-alarm fires, two-alarm fires, three-alarm fires; the categories classify the seriousness of the fire, which is a threat in our case. As a Security Analyst, you will learn how to prioritise the alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High, and Critical. Of course, it is an easy guess that you will need to start from the highest level (Critical) and work towards the bottom - Low-level alert. Having properly configured security monitoring tools in place will give you the best chance to mitigate the threat.

After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes action on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more. 

The first thing almost every Junior (Associate) Security Analyst does on their shift is to look at the tickets to see if any alerts got generated.
