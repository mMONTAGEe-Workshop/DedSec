# WiFi Protocols and Security

WiFi is a wireless network, Most of us have connected to WiFi network, Laptop, Touchpad or smartphone

We from menu choose network name and supply it the password of that network, there also _public_ networks which don't require password and can be freely joined

##### Protocol 1.
**WEP** _(Wired Equivalent Privacy)_, Developed in 1999, Earliest security protocol. **_40 bit encryption key_** was volnurable and not secure and could be easily hacked, This protocol since then is never used.

##### Protocol 2.
**WPA** _(Wi-Fi Protected Access)_ It was developed to solve problems of WEP, It uses **TKIP** _(Temporal Key Inetgration Protocol)_ Encryption, which is much stronger than 40 bit key. It Dynamically changes it keys as it being used which ensures data integrity. WPA Is no more used becouse TKIP is outdated for today

##### Protocol 3.
**WPA 2** _(Wi-Fi Protected Access)_ Provides even stronger security than WPA, And it does it by using stronger encryption requirement. WPA2 Uses **AES** _(Advanced Encryption Standart)_ AES Uses Symmetric Encryption Algorithm which makes it strong enough to resist brute force attack, which even got adopted by U.S Goverment and used to encrypt sensitive data.

##### Protocol 4.
**WPA 3** _(Wi-Fi Protected Access)_ Next Generation of Wireless Protection, Was Introduced in 2018, "Provides Cutting--edge security protocols to the market" "Adds new features to simplify wi-fi security, and enable robust authentication" "receive increased protection from password guessing attempts" 

##### Public Protocol.
**WPS** _(Wi-Fi Portected Setup)_ Was Designed to make it as easy as possible to join protected wireless network, For Example Wi-Fi modern printers will have physical WPS button to join the network. F.E you will press WPS button on the router and in 2 minutes you will press WPS button on the printer and then the printer would connect to wi-fi router in seconds

### Access Control (For Wires Devices)
In this option we can either allow or block a device from joining. Every device has unique MAC address which we can allow/block. when device is blocked it will only be able to get IP address but not communicate
