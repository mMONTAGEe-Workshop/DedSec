### What is Embedded Device?

Embedded chip is a computer small enough to be component of a device that they control, those chips usually happen to be as microprocessors
that have memory and interface which they are controlled from, BIOS for example.. Word _"Embedded"_ underline that these microprocessors are deep within the device and shouldn't be accessed from outside.

Sometimes microprocessors that do transactions must be almost impossible to see for user, and user should not have access to the microprocessor modify,break,configure their software them in any way.

### What do Embedded chips do?

They are used in many applications, their capabilities able to run functional Operation Systems such as Android on smart TV for example even in smart toothbrushes connected to internet.

Access to embedded chips for sure is very limited for their guarantee, security risks. Limited access making reverse-engineering only interesting. in Embedded chips you can find various boards, processors and operation systems.

Certain chipsets ensure safety and security of usage of device and can have specific mechanisms, which brick the system if the chip's normal conditions of work are intervened. For example 90's consoles to jailbreak had their chips to be specificly replaced to trick system thinking the chip was inplace.
