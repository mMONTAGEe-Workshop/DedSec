## How do chips look

Embedded microprocessors perfom one or another function depending on device in which they are embedded. compromises are always made during development. 
Such as Security, Functionality, Quality, Size, Power Consumption, and Export to Market and Price. 

Yes even Security can be compromised by manufacturer itself. Realisation variety allows create alot unique projects and suitable for any specific application. 

For Example: in Automobile electric block, an emphasis on safety may mean that several cores of central processor unit (CPU) same time calculate same brake drive, for other system could verify the calculations.

Security sometimes play as the main function in microprocessor, In Credit Cars, financial security is very crucial but even there it must go into compromises to make its affordable for everyone.

**_Application-specific integrated circuits, ASIC_** replace basic microprocessors Personalised Operation Systems are replaced with FreeRTOS, bare naked Linux core or entire Android.
